Setup Instructions

    Clone the repository or download the source code.
    Open index.html in your browser.

No additional setup is required, as this project does not depend on any frameworks or libraries other than the external API.
Code Overview
HTML Structure

The HTML structure includes:

    Form: For entering the search query.
    Input Field: To accept user search input (song title or artist name).
    Result Section: Where the search results and lyrics will be displayed.

JavaScript Code
Event Listeners

The JavaScript code listens for user actions and fetches data from the Lyrics.ovh API. Event listeners include:

    submit event on the form to handle search submissions.
    click event on the result container to detect when a user clicks on a song title.

Functions

    beginSearch(searchValue):
        Fetches search results based on the userâ€™s input by calling the API endpoint https://api.lyrics.ovh/suggest/{searchValue}.
        Parses the returned JSON data and sends it to the displayData function.

    displayData(data):
        Populates the result section with a list of songs retrieved from the API.
        Each song item displays the artist and song title, along with a clickable span element for fetching lyrics.

    getLyrics(artist, songTitle):
        Triggered when a song is clicked in the search results.
        Fetches lyrics for the selected song from the API https://api.lyrics.ovh/v1/{artist}/{songTitle}.
        Replaces the result section content with the fetched lyrics.

How It Works

    User Search:
        A user types a keyword in the search box and submits the form.
        If no keyword is entered, an alert is shown. If a keyword is provided, the beginSearch function is called.

    Fetching and Displaying Results:
        beginSearch retrieves song suggestions based on the search query.
        The returned list is formatted and displayed using the displayData function, which allows users to click on individual songs.

    Fetching and Displaying Lyrics:
        When a user clicks on a song, getLyrics is called with the selected artist and song title.
        The lyrics are retrieved, formatted, and displayed in the result section.

Potential Improvements

    Error Handling:
        Add error handling for failed API calls or unresponsive API endpoints.

    Pagination for Results:
        Implement pagination if the search result contains many items to avoid cluttered displays.

    Loading Spinner:
        Add a loading spinner to improve UX during data fetching.

    Mobile Responsiveness:
        Refine the design to ensure optimal usability on smaller screens.
